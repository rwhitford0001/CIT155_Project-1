	<h1>Reviews and Testimonials</h1>
	
	<p>Rebekah's Dragon Emporium has some of the healthiest dragons I have ever seen. The dragons there are very happy and energetic. ...perhaps too energetic. One tried to eat my shoe. <br> --Fantastical Pets magazine</p>
	
	<p>The dragons are given an excellent amount of space. Rebekah's Dragon Emporium only buys dragons from reputable breeders, so you don't need to worry that their dragons have any illnesses or genetic defects. My only concern is the lack of variety. Green dragons deserve loving homes too! <br> --Society for Magical Animal Awareness</p>
	
	<p>The Emporium is a recent addition to our fair kingdom, but one that I believe shall serve us well. Magical pets are a booming business, and I doubt it will be long before we see other pet stores offering griffons and pixies. I sincerely hope that they will hold themselves to the same level of quality as Rebekah's Dragon Emporium. <br> --Kingsland Financial Gazette</p>
