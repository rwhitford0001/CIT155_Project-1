		<h1>Our Three Main Breeds of Dragons</h1>
		
			<article>
			<h3>Red Dragons</h3>
			<p>Red dragons are hot tempered and proud. They are not recommended for beginners. A red dragon is a lifelong commitment, as they will live a healthy lifespan of 40 years if properly cared for. Red dragons are exclusively carnivorous.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
			<h3>Black Dragons</h3>
			<p>Black dragons are on the smaller side, but highly intelligent. Some breeders have described them as having a "cat like" temperament. Black dragons are one of the easier breeds to care for, but have expensive dietary needs. They should mostly be fed fresh fish.

			<h3>Gold Dragons</h3>
			<p>Gold dragons are highly affectionate, but often overly protective. Owners should take care to acclimate them to strangers slowly. Gold dragons make excellent guard-dragons as long as they are properly cared for and trained.</p>
