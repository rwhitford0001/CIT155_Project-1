			<h1>Safety Warnings and Disclaimers</h1>
		
			<p>While modern dragons have been bred for centuries to be friendly and loving companions, it is important to remember that they are descended from powerful and dangerous creatures, and have retained much of their natural defenses. A well trained and cared for dragon will rarely give more than a playful nip, but a neglected or abused dragon may defend itself violently if it feels that it is in danger. A happy dragon is a safe dragon.</p>
			
			<h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
			
			<p>Dragons should never be underfed. If a dragon begins growling at you or otherwise acts aggressive, you should back away slowly so that the dragon does not feel threatened. Dragons should be allowed a small hoard of shiny objects to play with. This will reduce unwanted behavior such as stealing the household silver. If you feel that you are unable to properly care for your dragon after purchasing it, you may return it to the store within 60 days for a partial refund.</p>
