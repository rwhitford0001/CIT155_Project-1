	<h1>Office Hours</h1>
	
	<p>To see our dragons in person, you can visit our store between 9AM through 5PM, Monday through Friday. We are unavailable on most federal holidays. Weekends can be booked for birthday parties or other private events. Children attending such events should be advised not to wear tiaras or too much metal as the dragons may mistake them for princesses or knights.</p>
	
	<p>We can hold dragons by request, but only for a maximum of one week before we will re-list them for sale.</p>
	
	<h2>Contact Info</h2>
		
	<p>If you have any questions, feel free to visit the store, call us at 1(800)DRAGON-STORE, or send us an email at rwhitford0001@kctcs.edu. We used to have a fax machine, but one of our red dragons melted it. At the moment we will not be able to accept faxes. Pigeons should not be used to deliver messages as they will usually be too afraid of the dragons.</p>
